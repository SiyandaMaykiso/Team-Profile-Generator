# Functionality

## User Input on Command Line

A team summary will be generated from user input. Using the command line, the user will input key information about the team manager. The user then can add any number of engineers and/or interns and input information for each new employee.

## Validation of Input

If the user does not met necessary requirements when inputting employee data, that employee's data is not saved and the user is prompted to re-enter the data in the correct format.

## HTML Output

This application stores the information for each employee as an object, using the object constructors in the library javascript files, and then use the object to make individual html cards. Once all cards are generated, a single html document is written and saved in the output folder, displaying all of the employees information.

## Code Testing

Jest is used to ensure the functionality of the different classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern.
